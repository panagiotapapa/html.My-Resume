<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I enjoy staying active and creative. I play basketball at an amateur level, which helps me connect even more with the sport I coach. In my free time, I love music, cooking, and playing video games, while outdoor activities and working with children through camps and volunteer programs keep me inspired. These interests help me stay energetic, patient, and motivated—qualities I bring into my coaching every day.
